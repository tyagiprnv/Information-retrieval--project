0,1745976,M1584957,Multiinfarkt- und Alzheimersche Demenz--differentialdiagnostische Probleme.,"The differential diagnosis of Alzheimer's and so-called multi-infarct dementia is still a major problem in clinical dementia research. It was Binswanger who in 1894 pointed out that a subtype of vascular dementia exists which is characterized by subcortical arteriosclerotic encephalopathy. It is this type that can most easily be mistaken for Alzheimer's dementia, presented for the first time in 1906, which may be associated with congophilic angiopathy leading to brain infarction. Beyond clinical criteria, which in part are summarized in Hachinski's ischemic score, further advancement of brain imaging techniques, especially those yielding perfusion or metabolic data, has facilitated and substantiated clinical in vivo distinction.",ger,0.8226191162344882

After a single oral dose of 10 mg sabeluzole, the peak plasma concentration was attained at 1 to 4 h; it averaged 42 ng.ml-1. On repeated dosing (10 mg b.d.), steady-state was virtually attained after 3 days of treatment. Steady-state mean trough and peak plasma concentrations fluctuated between 53 and 94 ng.ml-1. The mean terminal half-life after a single dose and at steady-state was of the order of 33 h.

The pathological changes seen in SDLT include the presence of cortical Lewy bodies (LB) frequently, but not invariably, associated with senile plaque (SP) formation. Whilst neocortical neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) are sparse or absent, a proportion of these cases show involvement of the temporal archicortex by lesions comprising Alzheimer-type pathology (ATP, i.e. NFT, SP and granulovacuolar degeneration [GVD]). Thus the relationship between SDLT and senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) is complex and controversial. In this study quantitative neuropathology was used to compare the intensity and distribution of ATP in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of 53 patients from 3 disease groups (SDLT, SDAT, Parkinson's disease (PD)) and a group of neurologically and mentally normal elderly control patients. For most brain areas examined the extent of ATP between the patient groups followed the trend SDAT greater than SDLT greater than PD greater than control. Statistical comparison of these groups revealed significant differences between the mean densities of NFT, SP and GVD although individual cases showed considerable variability. These results confirm additional pathological differences between SDAT and SDLT regarding the intensity of involvement of the temporal archicortex by ATP. Many patients with Lewy body disorders (LBdis) show a predisposition to develop ATP albeit in a more restricted distribution (e.g. low or absent neocortical NFT) and at lower densities than is found in SDAT. Some cases of SDLT show minimal SP and NFT formation in both neocortex and archicortex supporting previously published data distinguishing this group from Alzheimer's disease.",eng,0.7856280768955837

Despite the varied etiology the clinical consequences are relatively stereotyped which suggests that the diverse insults that cause delirium may act by common metabolic and cellular ""final pathways."" Related molecular and cellular mechanisms may be involved in aging and Alzheimer's disease, conditions that predispose to the development of delirium. Animal models of delirium better reflect age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease than those that impair a single neurotransmitter system such as the cholinergic system; the metabolic encephalopathies produce global cognitive disturbance, which is more typical of these disorders.

However, the underlying cause for this slowing may be different in the two disorders. This research examined whether the behavioral slowing found in Alzheimer patients results from a reduction in their rate of cognitive processing, whereas the slowing in depressed geriatric patients reflects a purely motor retardation. This hypothesis was tested using a task in which subjects had simply to determine the number of dots present in an array (i.e., enumeration). In all four subject groups (Alzheimer patients, depressed geriatric patients, healthy old controls, and healthy young controls), response time increased linearly with array size. The slope of this linear function (reflecting rate of enumeration) was the same in the normal and depressed patients, but was significantly greater in the Alzheimer patients, suggesting the presence of a cognitive slowing in Alzheimer's disease, but not in depression.",eng,0.7830825652020503

It was hypothesized that these two patient groups would also have an increased number of neurologic soft signs. The relationship of neurologic examination, tests of auditory-visual integration, and intelligence quotient, and diagnoses was studied for 350 patients. Tests of reliability and persistence for all observed signs were performed. The EUCD and SPA groups had increased evidence of neurologic soft signs. Differences in patterns of IQ scores also suggest that different forms of brain damage may be present in these two groups. When the two groups were removed from the larger patient sample, those patients with other types of schizophrenia and character disorder did not exhibit evidence of neurologic impairment. This study of neurologic soft signs adds to the validity of considering SPA and EUCD as separate diagnostic entities.",eng,0.7785080027495547

30,1856835,M1695887,Sprachveränderungen bei der Demenz.,"This review analyzes the spectrum of language deficits commonly encountered in dementia. A specific communication profile is found in dementia of the ""cortical"" type, such as Alzheimer's disease. With advancing disease lexical, comprehension and pragmatic functions deteriorate, whereas syntax and phonology tend to be preserved. This pattern bears some resemblance to aphasia types like transcortical and Wernicke's aphasia, however, a much broader range of communicative functions is impaired in Alzheimer's disease than in aphasia. Differentiation of dementia and aphasia, especially in elderly patients requires careful neuropsychological assessment of language, memory and other psychological functions. ""Subcortical"" dementia commonly presents with dysarthria as the leading symptom and linguistic impairment is rarely of crucial importance until late stages. Thus, the interetiologic dissociation of language and speech impairment can be used for dementia differentiation. Aphasia batteries are not sufficient to comprehend the range of language deficits in demented patients. Testing the communication impairment in dementia requires specific tasks for spontaneous speech, naming, comprehension, reading, writing, repetition and motor speech functions. Tasks for verbal learning and metalinguistic abilities should also be performed. Language deficits are frequent initial symptoms of dementia, thus language assessment may be of diagnostic relevance. Many data support the concept that the communication deficit in dementia results from a particular impairment of semantic memory.",ger,0.7678870726507837

12,1701343,M1540305,Concentrations of monoamines and their metabolites in the cerebrospinal fluid from patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer type and vascular dementia of the Binswanger type.,"We measured the concentrations of total (conjugated and unconjugated) monoamines (dopamine, DA; norepinephrine, NE) and monoamine metabolites (homovanillic acid, HVA; 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenyleneglycol, MHPG; 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, 5-HIAA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), using HPLC-ECD in 11 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT), 17 patients with vascular dementia of the Binswanger type (VDBT), and 15 controls. In AD/SDAT, there was a significant decrease in the DA concentration and a significant increase in the MHPG concentration. The average NE concentration was not altered, but significantly increased with the progression of intellectual disability. There were no significant changes in HVA and 5-HIAA concentrations. Patients with VDBT showed a significant increase in the DA concentration and a significant decrease in HVA and 5-HIAA concentrations. The DA concentrations increased significantly with the progression of dementia and ventricular enlargement. These results indicate that the noradrenergic and dopaminergic system in particular are altered in AD/SDAT, while the dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are mainly involved in VDBT.",eng,0.784707036043775

14,1247931,M1086053,An immunological approach to dementia in the elderly.,"A study into the relationship of immune change in the serum and the presence of senile dementia is reported. Three groups were studied, senile dementia, cerebrovascular disease and subjects without evidence of brain disease. All were aged 65 years and over. The immunofluorescent studies showed an excess of antineuronal reactivity and a fall in antinuclear antibody in females with senile dementia. There was no significant difference between the groups in respect of immunoglobulins, slide latex and a complement fixation test, against a variety of tissues. The significance of the findings in relation to other published results is discussed.",eng,0.7840575760034713
19,1568494,M1407412,Cerebrospinal fluid endothelin-1 in Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia of Alzheimer type.,"We have measured the endothelin-1 concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid samples from 5 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 6 patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type (SDAT) and 7 patients with other diseases without dementia (disease control: DC). The cerebrospinal fluid endothelin-1 level was significantly lower in AD than in DC. No correlation was observed between cerebrospinal fluid endothelin-1 concentration and any other factors such as age, duration from onset, systolic blood pressure, cerebrospinal fluid protein level or plasma endothelin-1 concentration in AD or SDAT. These results suggest a possible alteration of the endothelin-1 system in the central nervous system in Alzheimer's disease.",eng,0.7830483465899167
24,1592103,M1431023,Treatment of depression in elderly patients with and without dementia disorders.,"In two inter-Nordic multicenter controlled studies the effect of Citalopram on elderly patients with depression and emotional disturbances has been studied. One investigation included 98 patients in whom Alzheimer type dementia (AD/SDAT) and vascular dementia (VD) had been diagnosed, many of whom also had emotional disturbances. After four weeks treatment with Citalopram (10-30 mg/daily) there was significant improvement in confusion, irritability, anxiety, depressed mood and restlessness. No effect was seen on the intellectual capacity or motor performance measured. In the other study, which was a six weeks trial comparing Citalopram and placebo, elderly patients with a treatment-requiring depression were treated. Demented as well as non-demented patients were included. The Hamilton Depression Scale, the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and The Clinical Global Impressions all recorded an effect of Citalopram superior to that of placebo. In both studies depressive symptoms as well as symptoms of agitation, anxiety, restlessness and irritability improved. Citalopram is therefore considered not only an antidepressive drug but also an emotional stabilizer. The drug was well tolerated by elderly often somatically ill patients. Side effects were few.",eng,0.7792518950164676

26,82424,M27101140,Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease Dementia Are More Similar to Alzheimer's Disease than Dementia with Lewy Bodies: A Case-Control Study.,"Background and purpose!#!Previous studies on the clinical and pathological manifestations of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) have reported findings more similar to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) than to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to investigate the neuropsychiatric symptoms of PDD compared to DLB and AD.!##!Methods!#!We conducted a retrospective case-control study on 125 newly diagnosed consecutive PDD patients and age- and dementia stage-matched controls with either DLB (N = 250) or AD (N = 500) who visited the same hospital over the same period. For each case and control, neuropsychiatric symptoms were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).!##!Results!#!Overall, 513 (58.6%) patients were female and 362 (41.4%) were male. Comparisons of clinical data revealed that the PDD group, similar to the AD group, had a lower NPI total score, NPI caregiver burden score, and rate of antipsychotic use (all p < 0.001) than the DLB group. One or more psychiatric symptoms were reported in 95.2% of the PDD, 99.2% of the DLB, and 96.8% of the AD patients. The PDD group had lower subscores in the items of delusions, hallucinations, agitation, anxiety, irritation, aberrant motor behavior compared to the DLB group. Severe neuropsychiatric symptoms among all dementia patients were associated with younger age, more advanced stage, and a diagnosis of DLB.!##!Conclusion!#!Neuropsychiatric symptoms in PDD were more like those in AD than in DLB. Severe neuropsychiatric symptoms in degenerative dementia were associated with younger age, more advanced stage of dementia, and a diagnosis of DLB.",eng,0.7787323486757841

The same types of plaques are observed, as with immunostains for beta-protein, including the very simple ones, consisting nearly exclusively of loose deposits of beta-protein. If there are many plaques, the normal network of AChE-positive axons disappears. Explanations for both, the apparent shift of AChE from the axons to the plaques on the one hand and the very early development of AChE positive deposits during the plaque development on the other hand are sought.",ger,0.7765928524560769
32,1597330,M1436251,Brain mapping zur Darstellung altersabhängiger Veränderungen in Abgrenzung von Demenz.,"BM-EEG (Brain Mapping) and BM-P300 was studied for age related changes in 63 healthy controls (17.1-87.9 years). Additionally the discriminative power of both functional measures was tested in 21 patients with the clinical diagnosis (NINCDS-ADRDA) of probable dementia of Alzheimer type (DAT) of mild to moderate degree (Global Deterioration Scale, 4.2 +/- 2.6). For global and regional absolute and relative power values in the 4 frequency bands alpha, beta, theta and delta, the alpha-peak, P300 latency and amplitudes, quantitative and topographical aspects were analysed. Despite a broad variation of normal values both tests revealed age related changes. For separation between DAT and normal controls BM-EEG was superior to BM-P300. Relative global and regional theta power was the most sensitive parameter to discriminate both groups. BM data are compared with reported findings of traditional EEG and cognitive evoked potentials.",ger,0.7609745958018943

The earliest, in most cases congenital extraneural signs were depigmented areas on the skin. They were absent only in one case. They allowed, together with the Westsyndrome to establish the diagnosis if tuberous sclerosis before the appearance of other characteristic symptoms. Sebaceous adenoma, generally accepted as pathognostic for tuberous sclerosis, presented itself in all 12 early cases later then the leukoderma and the epileptic fits. Tuberous sclerosis is one of the important causes of epilepsy in childhood, primarily in early childhood.

39,1856668,M1695720,Evaluation von 196 Patienten mit chronischer myeloischer Leukämie anhand eines Standard-Prognose-Modells.,"The clinical course of 196 patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) was studied. Prognostic factors were analyzed using a standard prognostic model. From a univariate analysis of patients with nonblastic Philadelphia chromosome-positive CML, splenomegaly, bone marrow fibrosis, percentage of blasts and promyelocytes in the peripheral blood and LDH activity were shown to be factors with a significant negative influence on survival. However, age and the platelet count did not influence survival. The standard prognostic model, generated with the 4 variables (1) percentage of blasts and promyelocytes, (2) spleen size, (3) platelet count and (4) age did not provide a useful representation of risk status in this heterogenous patient population. However, the addition of further variables (LDH, additional chromosomal aberrations, percentage of basophiles/eosinophiles and percentage of bone marrow blasts) to the standard model allowed a separation into 2 patient groups: one with low and the other with intermediate to high risk. Our data support the general validity of the prognostic model; however, the applicability of the model may be compromised in hematologic centers with a heterogenous CML population due to the selection of high-risk patients. In this situation additional risk factors may have to be added to the prognostic formula.",ger,0.7574951313014078
