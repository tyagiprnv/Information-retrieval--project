1562759,M1401674,The relationship between low vision and performance of activities of daily living in nursing home residents.,"Objective!#!To explore the link between low vision and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) performance in cognitively intact nursing home residents.!##!Design!#!Survey.!##!Setting!#!A non-profit geriatric long-term care facility.!##!Subjects!#!21 males, 82 females, aged 66-98.!##!Measures!#!Survey of 103 nursing home residents. ADL functioning assessed via Maryland Appraisal of Patient Progress (MAPP); medical data collected through chart review; ophthalmological data obtained through dilated eye examination by an ophthalmologist.!##!Results!#!In comparison with residents having good vision (n = 52), a significantly greater proportion of residents with low vision (n = 51) were dependent on caregivers for performing ADLs (eg, toileting, transferring, washing). Residents with low vision had significantly more eye pathology (eg, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration) than did residents with good vision. There were no significant differences between groups with regard to presence of musculoskeletal problems (eg, arthritis) or number of medical conditions (eg, cardiovascular disorder, cerebrovascular accident).!##!Conclusions!#!There is a strong link between low vision and ADL disability in nursing home residents. Moreover, ADL dependency is significantly related to the presence of eye disorders.",eng,0.7971363583582153
111598,M27982744,Factors that Influence Physical Activity among Residents in Assisted Living.,"The purpose of this study was to examine factors that influence physical activity among residents in assisted living. This was a secondary data analysis using baseline data from a function-focused care intervention study including 171 residents from 4 assisted living facilities. Using structural equation modeling, we found that mood, satisfaction with staff and activities, and social support for exercise were directly associated with time spent in physical activity. Gender, cognition, depression, and comorbidities were indirectly associated with physical activity and accounted for 13% of the total variance in physical activity. Implications for future research and social work practice are presented.",eng,0.7964409170569656
80049,M19177977,Teaching at an assisted living facility.,"The increase in assisted living facilities (ALFs) of various types has provided a new option for the delivery of clinical services to the elderly. For all these facilities, whether large or small, profit or nonprofit, primarily residential (the ""social model"") or with significant nursing care (the ""new"" model), their sole mission is to provide an appropriate level of residential and clinical services to their residents. However, given the rise in the number and variety of these facilities, there may be other uses to which they can be put. Specifically, these facilities may make excellent sites for the education and training of health care personnel. Acute care hospitals and nursing homes primarily deliver clinical services, but both are common sites for the training of a variety of health care personnel, both professional and nonprofessional. This article examines the teaching programs at one ALF and explores some possibilities for the future.",eng,0.7945571084851024

Participants completed questionnaires and physical performance tests, and wore the Fitbit Motion Tracker® to capture physical activity. Model fit was analyzed using two-level path models with residents nested within RC/AL settings. Model parameters were estimated using the MPlus robust maximum likelihood method. A multilevel model with good fit (root mean square error of approximation = 0.07, comparative fit index [CFI] = 0.91) showed that persons with greater exercise self-efficacy were more physically active, and persons who were more physically active had better physical function and less disability. Setting-level factors did not significantly correlate with physical activity or disability. Although environmental factors may influence physical activity behavior, only individual factors were associated with physical activity in this sample of RC/AL residents.",eng,0.7858123431731476

Over 14 months, while her home care agency reacted to the Balanced Budget Act, nine interviews were done with a 95-year-old woman who lived alone until she moved to an assisted living facility. Data analysis yielded structures of her changing experience of home care. Although primarily supportive services may have been inconsistent with Medicare regulations, such services may have influenced the favorable outcomes of sustaining elders at home and undergirding the rural economy.",eng,0.7842069053923804

Frequency and duration of service contacts were standardized to a 1 week period and pairwise comparisons were used to detect differences in care provided between the three settings.!##!Results!#!Minimal differences were found in overall intensity of service contacts across settings, however, the mix of services were different for patients living at home versus nursing home versus assisted living facility. Overall, more nurse care was provided at the beginning and end of the hospice episode; intensity of aide care services was higher in the middle portion of the hospice episode. Nearly 43% of the sample had hospice stays less than 2 weeks and up to 20% had stays greater than 6 months.!##!Conclusion!#!There are significant differences between characteristics of hospice patients in different settings, as well as the mix of services they receive. Medicare hospice payment methodology was revised starting in 2016. While the new payment structure is in greater alignment with the U shape distribution of services, it will be important to evaluate the impact of the new payment methodology on length of stay and mix of services by different providers across settings of care.",eng,0.7781759205933543

The women were divided according to whether they lived alone, with spouse only, or with persons other than (or in addition to) the spouse. Those living alone were found to have lower life satisfaction, lower self-esteem, and higher social dysfunction than those living with spouse or others. No differences were found with respect to depression, somatization, diet, or activity level. There was a significant interaction effect between race and living arrangement with respect to anxiety, with blacks being less anxious than whites when living with others, and more anxious when living alone or with only a spouse.",eng,0.7768250803775607

The aim of the present study was to investigate the end-of-life wishes and decision making among Japanese elderly people who required home care services. The study was designed to qualitative research strategies, using face to face interview data recorded in nursing care records, with a focus on advance care planning.!##!Design and methods!#!A total of 102 elderly people (47 males, 55 females) of 6 home care support offices in Hyogo prefecture participated.!##!Results and implications!#!We finally extracted the following 5 themes: anxiety about the future, abandonment of control, clinging to current daily life, precarious mutual support, delegating decision-making. While elderly people living at home generally feel anxious and fearful about the future, they seemed to try to avoid thinking too seriously about possible complications in their life. They also tend to leave end-of-life decision to someone else, and their decisions tend to change as they advance in age and as their condition deteriorates. Our findings suggest that medical professionals and care managers always support their patients' decisions, allowing for the views of the informal caregivers on whom elderly people rely for decision-making.",eng,0.7696782410519226
80012,M18236958,Determinants of resident autonomy in assisted living facilities: a review of the literature.,"Assisted living (AL) stresses the importance of resident autonomy in the provision of good quality care. Resident autonomy has been linked to better resident well-being, less reliance on supportive services, and greater participation in social activities. Little is known, however, about factors that foster resident autonomy in AL. This article reviews what is currently known about organizational determinants of resident autonomy in AL. The open-natural systems approach to organizational effectiveness, which views organizations in relation to their environment, provides a broad conceptual framework for this analysis. Factors that influence resident autonomy in AL are classified into two categories: (a) external environmental conditions (e.g., ownership status, chain membership, regulatory environment) and (b) internal organizational structures and processes (e.g., facility size, residents' functional ability, resident social resources, and staff work environment). Environmental conditions represent the most antecedent set of factors that influence resident autonomy, indirectly through their effects on internal organizational structures and processes. Internal organizational factors influence resident autonomy through their impact on policies that enable resident choice and control in the facility. More research is needed to better understand the complex mechanism(s) through which organizational factors influence resident autonomy.",eng,0.766958431116511
169000,M23718786,Living and dying: responsibility for end-of-life care in care homes without on-site nursing provision - a prospective study.,"The aim of the study was to describe the expectations and experiences of end-of-life care of older people resident in care homes, and how care home staff and the healthcare practitioners who visited the care home interpreted their role. A mixed-method design was used. The everyday experience of 121 residents from six care homes in the East of England were tracked; 63 residents, 30 care home staff with assorted roles and 19 National Health Service staff from different disciplines were interviewed. The review of care home notes demonstrated that residents had a wide range of healthcare problems. Length of time in the care homes, functional ability or episodes of ill-health were not necessarily meaningful indicators to staff that a resident was about to die. General Practitioner and district nursing services provided a frequent but episodic service to individual residents. There were two recurring themes that affected how staff engaged with the process of advance care planning with residents; 'talking about dying' and 'integrating living and dying'. All participants stated that they were committed to providing end-of-life care and supporting residents to die in the care home, if wanted. However, the process was complicated by an ongoing lack of clarity about roles and responsibilities in providing end-of-life care, doubts from care home and primary healthcare staff about their capacity to work together when residents' trajectories to death were unclear. The findings suggest that to support this population, there is a need for a pattern of working between health and care staff that can encourage review and discussion between multiple participants over sustained periods of time.

The aims of this study were to estimate the incidence rate of falls in a national, representative sample of Israeli elderly and to examine the association of falls with selected medical and social factors. A special national survey conducted in 1985 by the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics showed that among a representative sample of 3,494 community-dwelling elderly persons aged greater than or equal to 65, 24% reported a fall in the past year; the rate was 16% among men and 31% among women. The majority of falls reported happened out of doors. Of those who fell 37% subsequently visited the emergency room. Analyses adjusted for age and sex showed that single persons, particularly women, living alone reported falls at a higher rate than their married counterparts. Analyses adjusted for age, sex and mobility level showed that frequency of social interaction was inversely related to reported falls. Use of sleeping pills, problems with vision, and mobility restrictions were associated with falls in age- and sex-adjusted analyses. Advanced age (greater than 75 years) was associated with repeated falls that occurred both in the home and outdoors.",eng,0.7609324449407391

Knowledge was tested at baseline (T1), immediately after watching a Video on HFS (T2), and at 2-week follow-up (T3). A majority of the participants were Caucasian (n=9, 81.8%), and female (n=11, 91.7%); their mean age was 78years old (SD=12.7years). They had two chronic illnesses (n=1.8, SD=1.3), walked without help (n=7, 58.3%), and lived in a flat (n=10, 90.9%). Knowledge scores (percent correct) changed over time and were significantly different from T1 (46.7%) to T2 (59.2%, p=0.04) and from T1 (46.7%) to T3 (58.9%, p=0.04), but T2 and T3 (p=0.94) scores showed no difference. There is a need for educational HFS intervention programs aimed at this age group. This pilot successfully targeted active older adults living independently in sheltered housing complexes.

The deficiency at the level of manual rapidity is the most important element concerning the motive debility of mentally handicapped children. The tests show that there is no parallelism between the motive retardedness and the level of attainment of the corporal schema. In fact, the motor debility of 8 years old children is emphasized at the age of 10 with reference to normal children. On the other hand, if, at the age of 8, the mentally handicapped children have a lag of the corporal schema acquisition, these children have nearly overcome their retardedness at the age of 10.

1363119,M1201830,[Occupational therapeutic measures before and after surgical correction of hands with congenital malformations].,"The task of the occupational therapist following surgical procedures on deformed hands is discussed. In the child with congenital malformations, we must not only be concerned with treatment of the deformity but we must be concerned about the psychic problems which can develop following prolonged hospitalization or overprotection. One must be keenly observant to detect these problems early. Preoperative testing utilizing a standardized gripping test is carried out by the occupational therapist. The necessity for this is demonstrated by the example of the radial clubhand. In this way complications such as correction of clubhand in the face of a stiff elbow or pollicisation in the presence of inadequate clubhand correction can thus be avoided. After operation training in the new functions is begun as early as possible; preferably with individual supervision. Daily repetative and progressive exercises should result in maximum utilization of gripping ability provided by the operative procedure. The treatment program also includes the adaptation of clothing, the production of appliances and splints, in co-operation with the orthopedic technician, as well as specially designed functional exercises. All these factors are as important as the operative procedure itself in contributing to maximum benifit. All essential findings and their variations must be written down. Also the photographic documentation of the functions is the job of the occupational therapist. Sufficient time should be allowed prior to discharge to inform the parents about the newly acquired functions and the use of the applicances. The maintenance and further development of the newly acquired functions is insured through the continued ambulatory supervision by the doctor and the occupational therapist. The occupational therapist thus has a significant job as a member of the team in a special unit for children with congenital malformations.",ger,0.6781432672835789

Epidemiological, hematological, biological and immunological study of 2 villages of the Bamako region, Republic of Mali.","An haematological, biological, parasitological and immunological study about anaemia of pregnancy was carried out in two rural village of Mali Republic, where P. flaciparum malaria is hyper-endemic. The 25 pregnant women found in the villages were compared with 23 controls. One could observe that anaemia more often normochromic and regenerative usually appears during the second trimestre of pregnancy. Only a few cases with haemaglobin levels below 8 g. % are hypochromic. Serum transferrin levels were slightly higher among pregnant. None among 31 bone marrows examined showed megaloblastic changes. Haptoglobin levels below 10 mg. % were observed in 3/4 of the pregnant women versus 1/4 in controls. Like some others, this study confirms the primary responsability of malaria haemolysis in the aetiology of anaemia of pregnancy and the interest of systematic chemoprophylaxis, at least from the third month of pregnancy. Vitamin and iron therapy is to consider therafter in hyper-endemic areas of P. falciparum malaria when nutritional problems are not predominant.",fre,0.6775546760961004

1370966,M1209679,[A way to spatial irradiation planning. II. Vectorial demonstration of spatial dose distribution within a single-ray beam and 1st consequences for the practice].,"Spatial irradiation planning among other things demands spatial consideration of the dose distribution within the single useful ray beam. From this point of view, the vectorial dose quantities introduced in part I of this paper are reviewed, their correlations are examined as well as their dependences on different influencing quantities e.g. on the rotational position of the wedge filter with the central ray as an axis of rotation. The vectorial description of dose distribution used in this paper, additionally offers information on the total effect upon the inclination of isodose surfaces or curves respectively, caused either simultaneously by different influences (simultaneous effect) or in temporal succession by separate influences (succession effect). The correlations observed can be verified diagrammatically or dosimetrically using simple practical examples. Thus, it is possible for instance to obtain a continuous defined variation of the isodose inclination by varying the weights of the partial doses with successive irradiation with or without a wedge filter.",ger,0.6725264541990807
